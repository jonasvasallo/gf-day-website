          <br />
          <span>Happy girlfriend's day!</span>
          <br />
          <span>Thank you for being a part of my life. I want you to know how much I appreciate you and everything that you do for me. You've always given me your time even when you are busy and stressed with your problems. I am very grateful for your countless visits during my internship, it would've felt so lonely there if you weren't there. I am thankful that I get to have a partner such as you.</span>
          <br />
          <span>Hereâ€™s to many more adventures, sweet moments, and memories together. ðŸ’–</span>
